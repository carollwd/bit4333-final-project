# BIT4333-FINAL-PROJECT
This repository contains my BIT4333 Final Project, which uses the Student Performance Predictions dataset from Kaggle. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and prediction of student exam outcomes. The goal is to understand the factors that influence academic performance using supervised machine learning.
